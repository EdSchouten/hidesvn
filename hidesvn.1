.Sh NAME
.Nm hidesvn
.Nd hide Subversion data directories
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar command ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command can be prefixed to any commands to hide
.Pa .svn
directories from calls to
.Fn readdir
and
.Fn readdir_r .
This is especially useful when using commands like
.Xr grep 1
to search in directories recursively, but want to exclude any data files
from Subversion from the results.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr readdir 3 ,
.Xr readdir_r 3 ,
.Xr rtld 1
.Sh BUGS
Because this application only changes the behaviour of
.Fn readdir
and
.Fn readdir_r ,
applications that use functions like
.Fn seekdir
and
.Fn telldir
may get confused.
.Pp
Because
.Nm
uses
.Ev LD_PRELOAD
to preload a library,
.Nm
will not work with setuid applications.
